    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a popular programming language used for developing interactive and dynamic web applications. It is primarily used to add interactivity, manipulate web page content, and handle client-side operations. JavaScript can be embedded within HTML documents or included as external script files.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 45px;">Here are some key aspects and features of JavaScript:<br><br>
    1. Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is primarily executed on the client side, meaning it runs in the user's web browser. It allows web pages to respond to user actions, validate input, modify HTML content, and interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page.<br>
    2. Event-driven Programming: JavaScript is event-driven, meaning it responds to events triggered by user actions (e.g., clicks, mouse movements) or changes in the web page (e.g., form submissions, page load). Developers can define event handlers or listeners to execute specific actions when events occur.<br><br>
    3. Manipulating the DOM: JavaScript provides powerful APIs to interact with and modify the DOM, which represents the structure and content of the web page. It allows developers to dynamically create, modify, or remove HTML elements, change their styles, update text and attributes, and handle events.<br><br>
    4. Data Manipulation: JavaScript supports various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. It provides built-in methods and functions to perform operations on data, such as string manipulation, mathematical calculations, array manipulation, and date/time handling. <br><br>
    5. Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. Asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests or handling user input, can be performed without blocking the execution of other code, allowing for smoother user experiences and improved performance.
    6. Libraries and Frameworks: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that extend its capabilities and provide pre-built functionalities. Popular libraries and frameworks include React, Angular, Vue.js, jQuery, and many others, which simplify web development tasks, provide modular structures, and enhance code reusability.<br><br>
    7. Server-Side Development: With the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development. Node.js allows developers to build scalable, high-performance web applications using JavaScript on the server, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.<br><br></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 45px;">JavaScript is a versatile language that enables rich user experiences, interactive web applications, and dynamic content. It is widely supported by modern web browsers and has become an essential skill for web developers. With JavaScript, developers can create engaging interfaces, implement business logic, handle user input, and communicate with servers to build robust web applications.</p>
